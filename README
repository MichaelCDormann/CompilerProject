### Project Scope
The goal of this project is to create the quadruples discussed in class. These quadruples are the final result of the compiler. They are similar to the machine instructions that are generated by a typical compiler.

These quadruples consist of an operator, two operands, and a result.
Ex:  add  5  7  result

### General Design

This project was just a modification of project 3. Instead of doing semantic checks like in project 3 this project does the semantic actions. So essentially I just replaced every semantic check with a semantic action.

Each of these semantic actions are placed into a 2-dimensional list (basically a python list of lists), one row at a time. At the end of the program each row with it's quadruple is printed from this list.

### How to Run

* Obtain(somehow) a source file for a program written C-
* Run the Syntactic Analyzer with the command `./p4 [source file name]`
